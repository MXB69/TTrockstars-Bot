# TTrockstar-Bot
This version of the bot is runnable by navigating to the dist folder and running bot.exe.

If you want to make your own additions to the code I'd recommend opening the project in visual studio code and editing it from there. The main file is bot.py

The python file itself is reliant on the selenium module being installed and the version of python being greater than 3.5 although it may still work on versions below its just that I haven't tested it yet on those versions. But the bot.exe file is not reliant on python and can run as long as the whole folder of code is downloaded on your device.

Side Note: I think the chrome driver version that the bot runs on is based on version 90.0.4430.93 of Chrome so make sure you have that installed. Plus the code is reliant on the entire folder being downloaded since bot.exe has dependencies in the build folder. If you have any problems regarding the code I'd recommend contacting me at mtk2982007@outlook.com
